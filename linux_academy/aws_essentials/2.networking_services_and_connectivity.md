##### Networking Services and Connectivity

- AWS Global(physical) Infrastructure

- AWS Regions:
  - A grouping of AWS resources located in a specified geographical location.
  - Designed to service AWS customers that are located closest to a region.
  - Comprised of multiple `Availability Zones`.
  - Availability Zones(AZs) are where separate, physical AWS data centers are located.
  - Multiple AZs in each region provide redundancy for AWS resources in that `region`.

##### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- It is a private subsection of AWS that you can control, into which you can place AWS resources (such as EC2 instances and databases).
  - You have full control over who has access to the AWS resources that you place inside your VPC.
  
- VPC lets you provision a `logically isolated` section of the Amazon Web Services(AWS) cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a `virtual network` that you define.
  - You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own `IP address range`, creation of `subnets` and configuration of `route tables` and `network gateways`.
  
- When we create AWS account, a default `VPC` is created for us. Which includes the standard components that are needed to make it functional:
  - Internet Gateway (IGW)
  - A route table (with predefined routes to the default subnets)
  - A `Network Access Control List` (with predefined rules for access like a firewall)
  - Subnets to provision AWS resources in(such as EC2 instances)

##### Internet Gateways (IGW)

- A combination of hardware and software that provides private network with a route to the world outside(internet) of the VPC.
- TGW is a horizontally scaled, redundant and higly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in our VPC and the internet.
  - It therefore imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on our network traffic.

- Default VPC already has an IGW attached.

- Route tables rules and details:
  - Only 1 IGW can be attached to a VPC at a time.
  - An IGW cannot be detached from a VPC while there are active AWS resources in the VPC(EC2, RDS etc.,)

##### Route Tables (RTs)

- A route table contains a `set of rules`, called `routes`, that are used to determine where `network traffic is directed`.
- Default VPC already has a main route table.
- Routes table rules and details:
  - We can have multiple active route tables in a VPC.
  - You cannot delete a route table if it has dependencies (associated subnets)

##### Network Access Control List (NACLs)

- NACL is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for contributing traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
- Default VPC already has an NACL in place and associated with the default subnets.
- NACLs are stateless, so you must create both inbound(incomming traffic ) as well as outbound(out going traffic) rules.
  
- Inbound rule e.g.,:
```bash
Rule #      Type            Protocol    Port Range      Source      Allow / Deny
_____________________________________________________________________________
100         ALL Traffic     ALL         ALL             0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW
*           ALL Traffic     ALL         ALL             0.0.0.0/0   DENY
```

- Rules are evaluated based on rule # from lowest to highest.
- The first rule evaluated that applies to the traffic type gets immediately applied and executed regardless of the rules that come after (have a higher rule #).
- And if non rules matches than the default `*` rule is applied.

```bash
Rule #      Type            Protocol    Port Range      Source      Allow / Deny
_____________________________________________________________________________
90          SSH (22)        TCP (6)     22              0.0.0.0/0   DENY
100         SSH (22)        TCP (6)     22              0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW
*           ALL Traffic     ALL         ALL             0.0.0.0/0   DENY
```

- So remove # 90 to allow traffic on port 22 for ssh.

- In the above case for ssh incoming traffic it will match # 90 first so it will get denied even though # 100 allows it.

- As NACL is stateless both inbound and outbound rules must be defined.
- Outbound rule for the above ssh inbound rule.

```bash
Rule #      Type                    Protocol    Port Range      Destination      Allow / Deny
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
100         Custom TCP Rule        TCP (6)      1024-65535      0.0.0.0/0        ALLOW
```

- Outbound Port Range is defined `1024-65535` even though inbound port for ssh is 22, when it exists the NACL, it exists on an `ephemeral port` (temporary port) which could be in range `1024-65535`.

- When you create a new NACL, all traffic is denied by default.
